	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving logical problems and building efficient solutions that have real-world impact. I'm particularly interested in writing clean and optimized code with good Time Complexity, which helps applications run faster and more reliably. The ability to improve systems and make processes more efficient through development excites me. It’s a field where continuous learning and creativity go hand in hand, 
		and I’m motivated by the challenge of creating smart, scalable solutions.</p>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy designing solutions that are not only functional but also optimized in terms of time and space complexity. I’m fascinated by how algorithms can be improved to reduce space usage—for example, converting a solution from O(n²) to O(n) <b>Space Complexity</b> to make it more efficient for large-scale applications. Writing clean, scalable, and resource-conscious code gives me a sense of purpose, and I’m excited to keep growing in a field that constantly challenges me to think smarter and build better systems.</p>
